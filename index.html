          Collaborative software development is a complex process. For that matter, the notion of overview of the interplay of the code files among each other is crucial. Gitread represents code files in abstract form and shows file calls among the code. Network structures are revealed and new members may gain deeper and quicke understanding of the code as a whole. Commit history is discoverable on hover and single code lines may be compared and reverted. Beneath the file more meta data is being displayed among the contributor. Usually, files
          are being grouped and put in hierarchy depending on the folder they are placed in. In Gitread path derived hierarchy is represented by a dash »/« and files of same kind and meta data grouped automatically.

					One of the main functions of Gitread is to show a clear overview of which files are linked.
					Each connection starts form the position in which it appears in the code as a pink line that connects the two files.
					This allows for a better overview of the project as the entitre structure can be seen at a glance.

					Zoom-in for meta data
				</h3>
				<p>
					The metadata for each file is shown progressively on zoom-in.  This way, on a general view of the project (completely zoomed-out) only the file names, connections and a rough code structure can be seen.
					On zoom-in, many more details appear (such as lines of code, contributors, last commits) and the code structure gets more resolution.
